# Hi, I’m Jairo 👋

I’m a Fullstack Developer with hands-on experience building scalable and maintainable web applications. I currently work at a technology startup in Dublin, where I develop backend features using modern JavaScript and TypeScript technologies.

I’m particularly interested in clean code, modular architecture, and building reliable systems that are easy to maintain and extend.
